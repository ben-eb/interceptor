# interceptor

My second year assignment at University. I felt that this project would complement my existing website development and programming skills, whilst teaching me how to develop games and use JavaScript in a different context than what I was used to.

This project was a good learning experience overall, but it is very bare bones; the game can be beaten in around 5-6 minutes with tactical use of bombs.

There are still some things that are unfinished. Touch support needs to be extended to have a bomb and pause button, as well as a back button for the intel screen (currently the Escape key is the only way to get back to the main menu). Sound in the game needs debugging so that it does not glitch when the game's frame rate drops. An options screen needs adding so that the player can lower the graphics quality for increased performance, currently this is only available if the `options.js` file is modified.

The game is available to play at http://www.interceptorgame.com
